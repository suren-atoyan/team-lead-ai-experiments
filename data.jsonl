If you need to build on top of it to correct\n   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at\n   the tip of the \"master\".  This is not strictly necessary, but\n   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.\n\n * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic\n   branches, merge them into \"next\" branch.\n\nThe script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name\nto be \"next\", but it is trivial to make it configurable via\n$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.\n\nWith this workflow, you would want to know:\n\n(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to \"next\".  Young\n    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\n    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\n    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\n    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\n    not want to rewind it.\n\n(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\n    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\n    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\n    change things related to the topic as patches against your\n    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\n    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\n    tip of \"master\".\n\nLet's look at this example:\n\n\t\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\n\t\t  /       /           /           /\n\t\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\n\t\t/   /               /           /\n\t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\n\t      /   /   /             \\         /\n\t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\       /\n\t    /   /   /   /             \\     /\n    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\n\n\nA, B and C are topic branches.\n\n * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\n\n * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to \"master\" and \"next\",\n   and is ready to be deleted.\n\n * C has not merged to \"next\" at all.\n\nWe would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage\nB to be deleted.\n\nTo compute (1):\n\n\tgit rev-list ^master ^topic next\n\tgit rev-list ^master        next\n\n\tif these match, topic has not merged in next at all.\n\nTo compute (2):\n\n\tgit rev-list master..topic\n\n\tif this is empty, it is fully merged to \"master\".\n\nDOC_END\n"}

      {"prompt":"content of /README.md","completion":"<a href=\"http://react-pwa.surenatoyan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n <img src=\"./public/cover.png\" title=\"Base App\">\n</a>\n\n# React-PWA - `v2` is here 🚀🎉⚡️\n\n**Starter kit for modern web applications!**\n\n## Synopsis\n\nThis project (a GitHub template) is an opinionated setup for modern web applications.\nIt's a combination of essential (and minimal) libraries/components/utils/etc., which developers usually need during the process of making modern React applications.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAlmost all projects need to have a router, a UI framework, store integration, theming, error handling, base file/folder structure, a builder, some developer tools (eslint, prettier, etc), and many more. In this starter kit, we tried to put together the best options available from the above-mentioned fields. Out of the box, it provides a modern production-ready setup created by developers for developers 💚\n\n## Features\n\n- ✅ [Vite](#vite)\n- ✅ [React](#react)\n  - `v18` 🔥\n- ✅ [TypeScript](#typescript)\n- ✅ [Router](#router)\n  - `React Router v6`\n- ✅ [UI-framework](#ui-framework)\n  - `MUI v5`\n- ✅ [Store](#store)\n  - `Recoil`\n- ✅ [Notifications](#notifications)\n- ✅ [Theme](#theme)\n- ✅ [Base file/folder structure](#base-filefolder-structure)\n- ✅ [PWA](#pwa)\n- ✅ [Performance](#performance)\n- ✅ [Hotkeys](#hotkeys)\n- ✅ [Error Handling](#error-handling)\n- ✅ [Pages](#pages)\n- ✅ [Dev tools](#dev-tools)\n  - ✅ eslint\n  - ✅ prettier\n  - ✅ husky\n  - ✅ lint-staged\n  - ✅ https localhost\n\n#### Vite\n\n[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazingly fast build tool based on [native ES modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/), [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/), and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). `React-PWA` v1 was based on [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). We still love `CRA` and really think it's a great tool, but `Vite` provides a much better developer experience and it's unconditionally faster (maybe, we will also create a `CRA` version of `React-PWA` v2 in near future).\n\n#### React\n\nThe latest version (v18) is used here. All dependencies support [React](https://reactjs.org/) v18 and the `v2` is refactored according to the latest changes and requirements of `React` v18.\n\n#### TypeScript\n\n\"Not using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is like driving without a seatbelt\" - [Matt Howard](https://twitter.com/MattDotHow).\n\nFor those who are not familiar with `TypeScript` - don't worry, you will love it, as we all did. `TypeScript` is a superset of `JavaScript`; it should be very easy to work with if you know `JavaScript`.\n\n#### Router\n\n[React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/) is used here. You can find routing in the [src/routes](./src/routes/) folder.\n\n#### UI-framework\n\n[MUI](https://mui.com/) v5 is used here. `MUI` is a fully-loaded component library, super customizable, and easy to use.\n\n#### Store\n\nAs a store management tool [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) is used. Check the [src/store](./src/store) folder for more information.\n\n#### Notifications\n\nOut of the box you have a notification system. To show a simple notification you can use `useNotification` hook:\n\n```js\nimport { useNotifications } from '@/store/notifications';\n\nfunction MyCoolComponent() {\n  const [notifications, actions] = useNotification();\n\n  function showNotification() {\n    actions.push({ message: 'Բարև, կարմի՛ր արև' });\n  }\n\n  return (\n    ...\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Theme\n\nThe [theme system](./src/theme/) is based on [MUI Theme](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/#main-content). To get the current theme mode or to change it you can use `useTheme` hook:\n\n```js\n...\nimport { useTheme } from '@/store/theme';\n\nfunction MyCoolComponent() {\n  const [theme, actions] = useTheme();\n\n  // check the current theme mode\n  console.log(theme);\n\n  // if you want to change the theme, call an appropriate action\n  function toggleTheme() {\n    actions.toggle();\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nYou have access to `theme` object via `sx` prop and `styled-components`:\n\n```js\nimport Box from '@mui/material/Box';\nimport Button from '@mui/material/Button';\nimport { styled } from '@mui/system';\n\n// styled-components\nconst MyCoolButton = styled(Button)(({ theme }) => ({\n  marginRight: theme.spacing(1),\n  color: theme.palette.text.disabled,\n}));\n\n// sx prop\nfunction MyCoolComponent() {\n  return <Box sx={{ borderRadius: theme.shape.borderRadius }}>...</Box>;\n}\n```\n\nAlso, you can redefine the theme in the theme configuration file. Check the [src/theme/themes.ts](./src/theme/themes.ts) file for more information.\n\n#### Base file/folder structure\n\nHere how the base file/folder structure looks like:\n\n<img src=\"./public/file-folder-structure.png\" title=\"file folder structure\">\n\nTBD: more information about the file/folder structure will be added soon.\n\n#### PWA\n\nOut of the box, it's a `Progressive Web Application`. It can be installed on mobile and desktop devices 🙂, it can work offline, and many more. Check more about PWAs [here](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)\n\nYour users will also be informed about the new version of your app:\n\n<img src=\"./public/pwa-reload.png\" width=\"600\" title=\"pwa reload\">\n\n#### Performance\n\nAfter all these integrations the biggest bundle size is `~79KB`. It means even the first load will be pretty fast (in my case it's `1.1s`), further loads (already cached by `service worker` and `workbox`) will take `~0.25s`.\n\n<img src=\"./public/bundle.png\" title=\"bundle\">\n\n<img src=\"./public/audit.png\" title=\"audit\">\n\nNOTE: The performance is not 100 because it's running on demo server.\n\n#### Hotkeys\n\nA basic implementation of hotkeys is demonstrated here. Check the [src/sections/HotKeys](./src/sections/HotKeys/HotKeys.tsx) for more information.\n\nCurrently, you can use the following hotkeys:\n\n`Alt+s` - to toggle the theme mode\n`Alt+t` - to toggle the sidebar\n`Alt+/` - to open the hotkeys dialog\n\n#### Error Handling\n\nNobody likes white screens and crashes without any notes. In [src/error-handling](./src/error-handling) you can find the error handling implementation. Here you can find `withErrorHandler` high order component. You can wrap any component by this HOC and it will catch all errors and show a default or your custom fallback. Currently, the main APP component is wrapped by `withErrorHandler` HOC.\n\n#### Pages\n\nFrom a layout point of view the application consists of 3 main parts:\n\n- Header\n- Sidebar\n- Pages\n\nThe last one is a router-based switcher. All routes are defined in [src/routes](./src/routes/index.ts). By default, pages are being loaded asynchronously via [asyncComponentLoader](src/utils/loader/loader.tsx). You can use it to asynchronously load any `React` component you want. It uses `React.Suspense` and `React.lazy` with some magic 🧙‍♂️\n\n# Dev tools\n\n- [eslint](https://eslint.org/)\n\n  The latest version of `eslint` with the latest recommended collection of `eslint` rules is available out of the box. It contains:\n\n  - eslint:recommended\n  - react/recommended\n  - @typescript-eslint/recommended\n\n  Check the [.eslintrc.json](./eslintrc.json) file for more information.\n\n- [prettier](https://prettier.io/)\n\n  Stop fighting about styling in code reviews; save your time and energy - configure it once and let the machine format/correct your code.\n\n  Check the [.prettierrc.json](./prettierrc.json) file for more information.\n\n  There is an additional configuration for your import statements. They will be automatically ordered and grouped by the given rules (check the `.prettierrc.js`) - one more topic for debates in code reviews :)\n\n- [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)\n\n  You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc.\n\n  Currently, only `pre-commit` hook is set up. Every time you try to do a commit it will run `prettier` and `eslint` to be sure that everything is according to the rules.\n\n- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)\n\n  `lint-staged` helps to run `eslint` and `prettier` only on staged files - it makes the linting process super fast and sensible.\n\n- [https localhost](https://github.com/daquinoaldo/https-localhost)\n\n  It's a simple way to run your application on localhost with https.\n\n  Just run:\n\n  ```bash\n  npm run https-preview # or yarn https-preview\n  ```\n\n  after:\n\n  ```bash\n  npm run build # or yarn build\n  ```\n\n  and check `https://localhost` in your browser.\n\n  NOTE: first time it will ask you about installing localhost certificate. For more info check [this](https://github.com/daquinoaldo/https-localhost#root-required)\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use this template by just pressing `Use this template`.\n\n<img src=\"./public/use-template.png\" width=\"300\" title=\"Use this temaplte\">\n\nOr you can fork/clone it.\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install # or yarn\n```\n\nIn order to run it in development, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev # or yarn dev\n```\n\nIn order to do a production build, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build # yarn build\n```\n\nThere are two more scripts:\n\n`preview` and `https-preview`\n\n- `preview` command will boot up local static web server that serves the files from `dist` folder. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.\n- `https-preview` is the same, but with HTTPS. It's handy for testing your PWA capabilities in your local environment.\n\n## [Live Demo](https://react-pwa.surenatoyan.com/)\n\n<div>\n <img src=\"./public/demo-dark.png\" width=\"280\" title=\"Dark demo\"> <img src=\"./public/demo-light.png\" width=\"280\" title=\"Light demo\">\n</div>\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE)\n"}
